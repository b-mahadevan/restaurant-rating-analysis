# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Analysis & Prediction

This project explores and analyzes a restaurant dataset to uncover insights about cuisines, cities, customer preferences, and location-based trends. It also builds predictive models to estimate restaurant ratings using machine learning algorithms.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Rows: 9551
- Columns: 21
- Includes restaurant details like name, city, cuisines, cost, rating, votes, and geographic coordinates.

---

## 📌 Project Structure

The project is divided into **2 Levels** with a total of **6 Tasks**:

---

## ✅ Level 1 – Data Exploration & Preprocessing

### Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Identified missing values and handled them
- Checked and converted data types
- Analyzed target variable (`Aggregate rating`) for imbalance

### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
- Computed statistical metrics for numerical columns
- Explored key categorical features: `Country Code`, `City`, `Cuisines`
- Identified top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants

### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
- Plotted restaurants on a world map using latitude & longitude
- Analyzed location-wise distribution
- Checked correlation between rating and restaurant location

---

## 🔮 Level 2 – Advanced Insights & Modeling

### Task 1: Predictive Modeling
- Build regression models to predict restaurant rating
- Split dataset, train/test models
- Compare performance of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

### Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis
- Analyze the impact of cuisine type on restaurant rating
- Identify most popular cuisines based on number of votes
- Find cuisines that receive the highest ratings

### Task 3: Visual Insights
- Histogram and bar plots of ratings
- Compare average ratings by city and cuisine
- Visualize correlations between features and the target

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Outcome

- Insights into which cuisines and cities are most popular
- Built predictive models for restaurant ratings
- Visualized spatial and statistical patterns in customer preferences

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Integrate NLP for restaurant reviews (if available)
- Deploy the model using a web framework like Streamlit or Flask
- Create an interactive dashboard
